# PXIe-148X Getting Started Example - Common Generation Tutorials
{: .no_toc }

** IN WORK - DOCUMENTATION IS INCOMPLETE AND IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT **

This document covers a range of common scenarios using the PXIe-148X Generation Getting Started Example (GSE) to help you understand LLP generation, I2C and GPIO timestamping, and common configuration options.

> Note: This document references the example included with the NI-FlexRIO 22Q3 driver. Examples included in newer releases of the driver should be appliable.
